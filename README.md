# World_Weather_Analysis

### Purpose
We were requested to put together a suggested app to identify vacation zones with hotel names that matched a current temperature preference and included the current weather condition. We then received an updated request to generate an itinerary with driving directions based on four locations within driving range. 

For this particular beta itinerary, we have chosen the following locations with the below route: 
- Selma, California, USA
- Rancho Palos Verdes, California, USA
- Redlands, California, USA
- Saint George, Utah, USA
